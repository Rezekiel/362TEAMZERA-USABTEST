Zera Usability Test
We’re asking people to try using a Web site we are working on and redesigning to test its functionality. The first thing I want to make clear right away is that we’re testing the site, not you. Also, please don’t worry that you’re going to hurt our
feelings. We’re doing this to improve the site, so we need to hear your honest reactions.
The form and feedback will only be used to help us figure out how to improve the site. Please try to be as detailed as possible in your responses. Thank you

3 Major Issues:
Make it more visually appealing and add more colors to it, color scheme could be improved.
Need for a clearer sense of what the website offer 
The nav bar works after scrolling down a bit on mobile.

Rationale behind chosen issues
These were the three most pressing issues found because they deal with the essentials of the website. The purpose (what the website offers) is very important to the company and the users hence why this must be addressed. The color schemes and functionality are also very important to a website. The website must be fully functional on all platforms and must be appealing to the eye without being too minimalist or distracting.  
Approach to implementing fixes/improvements to address the issue.
The first approach to addressing this issue would be to include more information in the home page. I found this initially difficult because I did not want to crowd it like the original ISUD website. Adding useful information that is also not repetive  to the home page is the most effective way of addressing the issue.
In terms of color scheme and more appeal, I could add more colors and containers so as it make it more colorful. I will implement this by adding different shades of gray and blue all over the website. I can consider background colors for certain texts and adding borders and banners across the linked pages. 
In order to fix the nav bar issue, I simply will have to add more styling. The problem is minor and the simple fix will go a long way into making it more convenient to mobile users. 
Future usability tests you’d run to ensure the quality of the fix.
In order to ensure the quality of the fix, a future usability test I would run would be to include the same participants as-well as different ones to run tasks based on the problems. Similar to the original test and task list, these tasks will be included among other tasks to do. They might also be asked questions that result in a response to the issues.
